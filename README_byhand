README

patagonian_fires has the filtered fires, excluding those smaller than 10 ha, 
not intersecting the study area or occurred before 1999. 

_extended includes a few fires meeting those conditions.

In kml files, the field "fire_id" was renamed "name", and 
"name" was renamed "name2" for them to display the fire_id
on the left menu on Google Earth.
